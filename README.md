# Untitled Autobattler Game Backend


Built with Rust, this project supplies the fixtures and battle logic for Untitled Autobattler Game.

Currently, the battles are calculated server side and fetched by the client to play through. We have an as-yet unused websockets implementation to power an upcoming drafting feature with which you'll be able to build your team and run a gauntlet of enemies.
